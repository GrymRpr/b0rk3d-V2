# Terminus: b0rk3d V2 *(formerly HorseMenu)*

A powerful, community-driven mod menu for **Red Dead Redemption 2** and **Red Dead Online** by Rockstar Games.  
**Strictly for educational purposes.**  

Remember: This is based in EARLY BETA Code and may not function as intended. I am pretty much
the sole tester for V2 So...

## Why This Fork?

- **Menu styling updates**
- **Feature expansions & fixes**
- **Add-ons & major UI improvements**
- The name **b0rk3d V2** ensures there’s no mistaking this for the Master build!

---

## Getting Started

1. **Download a popular injector** from GitHub and inject into `rdr2.exe`.
2. Or, grab an all-in-one (AIO) package with the latest build and custom injector from [PlumbWick3d’s Discord](https://discord.gg/ycbDQGqx3Q).
3. The new save settings folder is now located in: AppData\Roaming\Terminus-b0rk3d
4. Inject at the main menu not "In-Game"
